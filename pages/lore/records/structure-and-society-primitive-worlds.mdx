## Earth

Earth is unusual in its religious naievty.

While most intelligent worlds pay homage to multiple deities ruling over various forces of nature, peoples, and so forth, Earth had none.
While other primitive worlds, such as Mirth, struggled with _too many_ Gods, Earth arguably didn't have enough.
It was and remains Godless, and thus Earthlings (despite even still clinging to fabricated religions) are widely viewed as sacriligious.

The planet was not always godless, however.

In the year 2000 magic was discovered deep beneath the Earth's crusts, along with the ruins of ancient civilization, the Angels.
It was clear from restored texts that the angels worshipped a single god above all others, and that this god made it His mission to kill off all other gods,
absorbing their power in turn. Records found in these ruins concluded he succeeded in this conquest, becoming the singular Emperor God above all gods on Earth
for nearly 2 millenia. However, he was eventually betrayed by his most prized angel, Jesus. Jesus attempted to steal the many godly powers God collected,
and in this he was successful for a short time. Mad King Jesus ruled over the angels for nearly 50 years before the power fully corrupted him and he fell into a
disease-stricken rage, finally falling in what humans would later refer to as year 0 AD.

The other angels felt the powers were too much for any one being to hold, so they distributed the power back into the core of the Earth.
Without a central power, the angels disbanded and soon fell ill themselves.

All further records of them seem to be lost, except numerous "biblical" stories of Jesus and numerous other false deities fabricated by the Last Council of the
Angels and propagated throughout Earth to hide the truths of magic in hopes no new God would ever rise again.
