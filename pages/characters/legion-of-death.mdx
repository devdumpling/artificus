# The Legion of Death

> The common name for Jergal, late god of death, and his acolytes 

## Jergal, God of Death | *faerun, deity*

## Yrgret, Mirthian Folk Hero and Diplomat | *mirthian, humanoid*

**Campaign Notes**

During a chance encounter in The Singularity Tavern, tipped the party off to the location of Syndra Silvane


## Syndra Silvane, High-Acolyte | *faerun, humanoid*

Right-hand and late caretaker of Jergal. Living out the end of her days in Jergal's "temple", actually a small shack on the outskirts of Old Pinemont's Ruins. She refuses to speak on her past, but clearly had a strong bond with Jergal. She is an ordinary human and has been ressurrected multiple times by Jergal, and describes herself as beginning to wither, indicating that the Soulcatcher has been found and the ritual to control the death curse has begun. She estimates it began 7 days prior to meeting, which gives the party only 13 days to find the Soulcatcher and stop the ritual.

**Campaign Notes**

Informs the party of the existence of the death curse and an artifact that can be used to control it, the *Soulcatcher*. Encourages the party to seek out the less savory members of the Legion of Death, who may be able to help them in their quest.

## Ligzar, First Seat of the Legion | *faerun, goblin*

A charismatic goblin who holds the highest unofficially recognized seat possible in the legion, "First Seat". Despite his unassming size and demeanor, he was a respected member of the Legion, and it's said Jergal was often caught chatting with Ligzar before the convergence. The key to this bond may be due to Ligzar's impressive memory and attention to detail, which he uses to keep track of the Legion's many secrets, all of which he keeps in a massive, magically bound journal. He is a skilled tracker and is able to find the party's trail with ease.
