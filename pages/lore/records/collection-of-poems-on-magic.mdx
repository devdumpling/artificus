## Enil Magicus

Magic is, in some people's opinion, the embodiment of chaos.<br/>
It is a key capable of opening forbidden doors.<br/>
The doors, behind which, lurk fear and unimaginable horrors,<br/>
destructive powers.<br/>
The forces of pure evil, capable of annihilating<br/>
not only the one who opens the door,<br/>
but with them, the entire world.<br/>
And since there is no lack of those who try to open the door,<br/>
someone, at some point,<br/>
is going to make a mistake<br/>
and then the destructive of the world will be inevitable.<br/>
Magic is therefore the revenge<br/>
and the weapon of chaos.<br/>

Magic is the curse and undoing of the world--<br/>
the undoing of mankind.<br/>
Those who believe that magic is chaos<br/>
are not mistaken.<br/>

Magic is, in some people's opinion, art.<br/>
Great, elitist art.<br/>
Capable of creating beautiful and extraordinary things.<br/>
Magic is a talent granted to only a chosen few.<br/>
Others, deprived of talent, can only look at the results<br/>
of the artists works with admiration and envy,<br/>
can admire the finished work while feeling that,<br/>
without these creations and without this talent,<br/>
the world would be a poorer place.<br/>

Some chosen few discovered talent and magic within themselves.<br/>
The fact that they found art within themselves is the blessing of beauty.<br/>
Those who believe that magic is art<br/>
are also right.<br/>

There are also those according to whom magic is a science.<br/>
In order to master it, talent and innate ability alone<br/>
are not enough.<br/>
Years of keen study and arduous work are essential.<br/>
Endurance and self disclipline are necessary.<br/>
Magic acquired like this is knowledge, learning,<br/>
the limits of which are constantly stretched by enlightened and<br/>
vigorous minds. By experiments and practice.<br/>
Magic acquired in such a way is progress.<br/>
It is the plow. The loom. The watermill. The smelting furnace. The wedge and the pulley.<br/>
It is progress. Evolution. Change. It is constant movement, upwards, towards improvement. Towards the stars.<br/>

One day, magic will allow us<br/>
to reach the stars.<br/>
Those who consider magic to be a science<br/>
are also right.<br/>

Magic<br/>
is everywhere.<br/>
It is in the air we breathe.<br/>
It is in the water we drink.<br/>
It is in the food we eat.<br/>
It is in the clothes we wear.<br/>
It is in the houses we live in.<br/>
It is in the tools we use.<br/>
It is in the weapons we fight with.<br/>
It is in the books we read.<br/>

It is enough to simply<br/>
reach out<br/>
and touch it.<br/>
