### En Nirilith

Queen of New Silverymoon, Vessel of Mana

En Nirilith, descendent of En Noreldiae, is the ruling monarch of New Silverymoon. Though she claims the throne, she is a figurehead and not a political actor. However, she does sit on the Free Council as an advisor. She is also known as The Vessel, or the _Vessel of Mana_, and channels the will of Mana, Goddess of Magic. As such she was the most powerful mage in all of Faerun and commands the Enblade, a magical, sentient sword that is the physical manifestation of her power.
