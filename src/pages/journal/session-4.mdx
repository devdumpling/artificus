# Session 4 Recap

> For prior events, see the prior events section below (or previous journal entries)

Our party awoke to a disgruntled Ligzar, who led them to a mess hall to further discuss their quest. After hearing the half-goblin's plea, the party was mostly uninterested. However, a mysterious knocking deeper in the corridors of The Castle prompted the party to investigate. After a stern argument with a door, the party met Voa, an odd fellow who appears to have been staying (or trapped?) in a forbidden area of the castle for quite a time.

Ligzar turned up and was not pleased that the party had unlocked the door, however he made some notes about the interior. After some time, Ligzar left the party to their own devices. They quickly discovered the sad illusory wall hiding the entrance to a lone tower. The party made their way up the spire, stopping near the top when confronted with rickety wooden steps that would not hold their weight. After some trouble, the party made it inside, where they were met with numerous books, two desks filled with notes, a picture of Jergal with an X through him, and an opaque singularity portal. Phylondish and Decimus searched through the desks and discovered a love note from a "Henry", an emerald with a skull on it that was later identified as a key to the underworld, and a pewter key. Meanwhile, Elin explored her feline side and was led to a book that opened a hidden drawer, containing a lockbox. The key unlocked the lockbox, revealing a closed locket and a leatherbound journal. 

Within the journal were various notes, spells, and generally the work of someone following along in arcane studies. Later it's discovered that this is actually Elin's sister. The goblins arrive and Elin confronts Ligzar, who devolves into an unusual form and, under questioning, gives up some answers. 
Elin, determined to find her sister, struts into the portal. The party follows.

The portal shoots them out into a freefall. Below them they find an expansive jungle not unlike the Evergreen Mile, spreading as a near perfect circle. Massive bonelike, tusk-shaped spires border the perimeter of the forest, and beyond that an endless blue-tinted desert stretches into the beyond. As the party falls, they hear the familiar wail of Ligzar, tumbling helplessly through the air above them. 

## Prior Events (in reverse chronological order)

1. The party makes their way to The Castle, led by a serenading, charismatic, slightly nervous half-goblin, [Ligzar](/characters/legion-of-death#ligzar-first-seat-of-the-legion). Within the castle, the party learns they must stop whomever stole the Soulcatcher from completing the ritual. 
1. The hermit shack turned out to be Jergal, the recently killed Death God's, "temple". Syndra Silvane was there, and she explained that she would soon pass due to the death curse unraveling. She asked the party to find the Soulcatcher and destroy it. She indicated that the "death mark" on Decimus' hands which he received in the mist pass earlier was a sign that the party was chosen by the Legion of Death to do this.
1. Party rode the rails, eventually departing at the coordinates, where they found a pathway to a hermit shack.
1. Following those instructions, they passed through the mist passage and found the sketchy-looking skyrail system of Old Pinemont. 
1. The following morning, Byrde stole a painting from the wall. She was caught, most embarrassingly with her shoe stuck in the wall, but managed to talk her way out of reprocussions. The party got information from a couple on how to get to the coordinates provided by Yrgret. 
1. The party rest in a respectable inn, The Closed Doors for the night. 
1. A skirmish of Pteradons, guards, and refugees broke out outside the Pinemont town gates. The party was able to fend them off. <span className="text-red-500 font-semibold">A pteradon beheaded the refugee father from the intro in front of his two kids and wife.</span>
1. The party also received information about the "death curse" unraveling. They were tipped by the mysterious [Yrgret](/characters/legion-of-death#yrgret-mirthian-folk-hero-and-diplomat), informed that they should seek out [Syndra Silvane](/characters/legion-of-death#syndra-silvane-high-acolyte). 
1. The party attended The Singularity Tavern, where they met a few interesting barkeepers and learned of Queen En Nirlith's plan to explore. 
1. The party arrived at Pinemont where they met a curious fellow named Gesture (pronounced *Guessture*)
