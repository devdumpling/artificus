## The Fourth Month -- The Great Sorting

As people and creatures began to accept their new reality in The World, a great sorting took place. The inhabitants of the converged worlds sought out like-minded or familiar races and cultures, forming loose communities for safety, commerce, and camaraderie. While there was still much distrust and confusion among the various groups, this period marked the beginning of a new sense of unity among survivors.

During this time, a mysterious group known as the Keepers of Lore emerged. They sought to gather, preserve, and share knowledge from each of the Origins in order to foster understanding between the different worlds. The Keepers established the New Silverymoon Central Library, collecting and translating texts and historical records for public access. Their efforts would prove invaluable in promoting cooperation and understanding among the diverse inhabitants of The World.

## The Fifth to Eighth Month -- The Time of Exploration

With the environmental and magical chaos subsiding, exploration became the focus for many groups. Expeditions were launched to map the lands, seas, and skies of The World, and to discover the secrets and treasures it held. Magical and technological innovations from different worlds were shared and combined, leading to new advancements and understanding. Some explorers even managed to breach the boundaries of The World, venturing into the unknown realms beyond.

During this time, people began to discover new magical resources, artifacts, and creatures. Some of these discoveries brought great prosperity, while others brought danger and conflict. The mysterious origins of The World remained elusive, however, as no definitive cause for the Convergence could be found.
