With the authority of the Free Council, I hereby direct the following:

1. New Silverymoon will sustain no further refugees. The city is at capacity. New refugees will be turned to back into the Evergreen Mile.
1. We will seek refuge beyond our borders. For this tempestuous year, the Evergreen Mile has been our extended home. Despite our influence, the region remains destabilized. We will stabilize the area and establish new homes for the peoples of the Evergreen Mile.
1. We have endured this place. Now we will understand it. Those who join one of the exploratory guilds below will be granted a stipend and suplies, paid out through the guild of their choosing. Those who succeed in their respective ranks will be granted land.
   1. Those who seek wealth and the expansion of commerce, join the Merchant's Guild.
   1. Those who seek to rescue the lost and the forgotten, join the Knights of Silver.
   1. Those who seek to understand, document, and explore, join the Expedition Ardentia.
