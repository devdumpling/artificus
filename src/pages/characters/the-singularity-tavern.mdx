# The Singularity Tavern

A network of taverns connected through the singularity. These taverns mysteriously cropped up throughout the World. It's debated whether there are two or three taverns found thus far in the Evergreen Mile. There are certainly ones in New Silverymoon and Pinemont, and supposedly there's an unconfirmed third one somewhere out east. 

## Pinemont

### Sentinels

Each tavern has their sentinels that protect it. These otherwordly beings do not speak and are not known to be hostile except in the presence of violence in the tavern, in which case they have been known to take appropriate action: completely and instantly disintegrating the offending party.
