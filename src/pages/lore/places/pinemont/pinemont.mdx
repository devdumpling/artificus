# Pinemont

Built deep into the jungles of the Evergreen Mile, Pinemont is home to all sorts of adventurers, refugees, and otherfolk. It's a place where you can find a warm meal, a warm bed, and a warm welcome. It is the most populous safe haven in the area, save for the capitol city New Silverymoon far to the north. It is also home to a Singularity Tavern, dubbed "Monty's" by the locals. 

It's unclear what world Pinemont comes from, and none of the locals seem to know--they all claim to have arrived after the Convergence. This makes the existence of "Old Pinemont" particularly strange, as it appears to be the overgrown ruins of an ancient and powerful city, now completely abandoned save the railers, a colloqial term referring to those crazy enough to live on the skyrail system that still functions in the area.
