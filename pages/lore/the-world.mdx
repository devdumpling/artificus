## Core Assumptions

1. Nearly 1 year has passed since The World was created in the Convergence.
2. Gods exist, moreover, many are actively fighting for control after the Convergence.
3. Much of the World is unknown, possibly untamed, and definitely dangerous.
4. The World is magical, although magic may not be evenly distributed nor understood.
5. The World is a living, breathing entity, and it is not necessarily benevolent.
